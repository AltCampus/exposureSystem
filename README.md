# Exposure System

### Description

Exposure system is a new initiative to expose **Humans of AltCampus** to various ideas and opinions other than just programming, by providing them with articles and tasks on a regular basis.

This system also aims at bringing the people out of their comfort zone by giving them challenges, which would be in pairs or in groups. As part of motivating people to do stuff the system incentivizes completion of these challenges and punishes people who don't.
